(Alternatively, any other Apache-based distribution will also work)

A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Edge, or Firefox)

 Installation & Setup
Step  — Clone the Repository

Step  — Host the Project

Place the entire NUTRIPOS folder inside your local server directory (for example):

Step  — Run the Application

Start Apache and MySQL in XAMPP, then open your browser and go to:
